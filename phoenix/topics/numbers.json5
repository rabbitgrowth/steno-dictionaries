// I have two problems with the way Phoenix handles numbers:
//
// 1) The fact that it uses phonetic outlines for Arabic numerals
//    means that all spelled-out numbers, which include some very
//    common words with non-numerical senses, have to be starred:
//
//    WUPB  "1"    W*UPB  "one"
//    SEBGD "2nd"  S*EBGD "second"
//
//    The starred outlines also conflict with phrases:
//
//    TPOUR  "4"
//    TPO*UR "four", not "if you are"
//
// 2) In trying to cram almost every number from 1 to 99 into
//    one stroke, it sometimes resorts to weird mnemonics and
//    arbitrary shapes, resulting in ugly outlines:
//
//    STKPWAEPB "15" (STKPW for 5 because five keys)
//    KWOEU     "83" (KW for 8 and OEU for 3 for no reason)
//
//    The outlines don't even always work consistently. Normally,
//    TPH is associated with 9 and UPB with 1, so you'd expect
//    "91" to be TPHUPB, but that conflicts with "none", so "91"
//    is special-cased:
//
//    TPHUPB  "none"  TPHAOEUPBT/W-PB  "91"
//    TPH*UPB "nun"   TPHAO*EUPBT/W-PB "ninety-one"
//
// To solve this, use the number bar for Arabic numerals
// and unstarred phonetic outlines for spelled-out numbers.
