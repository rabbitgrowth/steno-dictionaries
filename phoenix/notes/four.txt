TPOUR  "4"
TPO*UR "four"
/      "if you are"

Solution: use the number bar for "4" and TPOUR for "four",
freeing up TPO*UR for "if you are".

TPOUL  "foul"
TPO*UL "fowl"
/      "if you will"

No satisfactory solution. Maybe use TPOUFBL for "fowl",
with "v" standing in for "w", to free up TPO*UL for
"if you will".
