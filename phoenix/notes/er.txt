Phoenix uses AEUR for /ɛr/, even when it's spelled "er":

PHAEUR/-T     "merit"
E/PHAEUR/T-S  "emeritus"
SRAEUR/TPAOEU "verify"

There are several problems with this.

Firstly, it might feel counterintuitive to use AEU when there's
neither "a" nor "i" in the spelling, especially if you come from
a more orthgraphic theory.

Secondly, it might cause conflicts:

AEUR/-R  "error"  (conflicts with "airer")
TAEUR/-R "terror" (conflicts with "tearer")

Seeing that Phoenix already uses ER as a disambiguator in
some conflicts:

PWAEUR/AE "bury"   PWER/AE or PWAEUR/AE/R-R "berry"
TPAEUR/AE "fairy"  TPER/AE or TPAEUR/AE/R-R "ferry"
PHAEUR/AE "marry"  PHER/AE or PHAEUR/AE/R-R "merry"

Why not generalize this and use ER for all /ɛr/ spelled "er"?

PHER/-T     "merit"
E/PHER/T-S  "emeritus"
SRER/TPAOEU "verify"

You can also brief "merit" as PHERT; while PHAEURT is "-imator",
PHERT doesn't conflict with anything.

ER joins AR and OR in the list of special rules:

AR  /ɔr/ spelled "war"
OR  used instead of AUR for beginning or medial /ɔr/
ER  /ɛr/ spelled "er"
